Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the following
email address: {{ email }}.

Follow the link below to reset your password:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Django Boards username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.

If you have received this mail in error, it is likely that another user
entered your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password.
If you did not initiate the request, you do not need to take any further
action can safely disregard this email.

Thanks,
---
